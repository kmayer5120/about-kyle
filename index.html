    My name is Kyle Mayer. Born and raised in Albuquerque, New Mexico. I have many interests from
    playing various instruments, music production, acrylic painting, and more recently home brewing!
    I am the happiest when I am learning something new.

    My previous career 5 years ago was in the restaurant industry.
    I was burnt out as a sous chef and needed a career change so I went back to school for
    computer science. I eventually changed my major to Computer Information Systems Programming
    concentration and graduated with an associate's Spring of 2020. I am taking this bootcamp
    to learn more about web development and also for the networking opportunities.

    Shown below is a picture of my wife, son, and myself at Christmas. It was my son's first Christmas!
    He is 1 year old as of January 7th and growing fast! My family is another reason for me taking on the
    challenge of this bootcamp. I want to be able to support them with a stable career in software development.
