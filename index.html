    <p>
        My name is Kyle Mayer. I'm 210 dog years old. I was born and braised in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

        I have many interests. I like playing various instruments, and my personal favorites are the triangle and jazz flute.
        I also enjoy producing doom-metal folk music, acrylic painting, and I've recently gotten into home brewing coffee! I also enjoy
        drifting in my Smart car on Central at 3am on Tuesdays with the bois.

    <p>A really real photo of me going really fast (but not at 3am).</p>

    <p>I also love keeping up on underground snail racing. The above photo is one of my favorite racers, Greta, at a
        championship I hosted on my own chalkboard a while ago. She's even faster than she looks.</p>
    <p>
        I am the happiest when I am learning something new. For instance, I just learned that I'm 30 years old in human years. Amazing!

        My previous career 35 dog-years ago was in the restaurant industry.
        I was burnt out as a sous chef and needed a career change so I went back to school for
        computer science. I eventually changed my major to Computer Information Systems Programming
        concentration and graduated with an associate's Spring of 2020. I am taking this bootcamp
        to learn more about web development and the networking opportunities, as well as how to sit in a chair for 40 hours a week.

        Shown below is a picture of my wife, son, and myself at Christmas. It was my son's first Christmas!
        He is 7 dog years old as of January 7th - it was his 'golden' birthday, if you will - and he's growing fast!
        My family is another reason for me taking on the
        challenge of this bootcamp. I want to be able to support them with a stable career in software development while
        also being able to pursue my dream of having my own fleet of sponsored racing snails. I understand the former won't be
        as lucrative as the latter, but we all need to start somewhere, yeah?
